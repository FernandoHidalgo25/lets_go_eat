# LetsGoEat

Welcome to my CLI Project where you will find a list of 10 japanese restaurants

## Installation

1. cd lets_go_eat
2. bundle
3. add folder: config
4. add file: key.rb
5. write in the key.rb
module Key

def self.access_key
  "(secret google maps API key)"*
end

end
* ask for a google maps API key or create your own API key

## Usage

You will have access a 10 japanese restaurants and for each restaurant you can see the following details:
    -Name
    -Address
    -Opening hours
    -Rating
    -User ratings total
There are different fun designs and also a hidden command if you enter kitchen after the description of any of the restaurants as well as when you exit you will find a nice panda :D

After doing each step from the installation then just follow the instructions I hope you have fun in this interactive CLI.
